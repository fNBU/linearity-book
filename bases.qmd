# Bases

Remember that the derivative function $D(f) := \frac{df}{dx}$ allows us to compute the derivative of, for example

$$
f(x) = x^2 + 4 \sin x
$$

if we know how to compute $D$ on only $x^2$ and $\sin x$.
In fact, knowing just how to compute $D$ on these two functions and knowing that $D$ is linear allows us to compute the derivative of any function of the form

$$
x \mapsto a x^2 + b \sin x , \quad a,b \in \mathbb R.
$$

::: {.callout-tip title="Notation"}

We just introduced the notation $\mapsto$.
This is a mathematician's way of referring to a function without giving it a name.

As an example both of

$$
x \mapsto x^2 \quad \text{and} \quad f(x) = x^2
$$

are the same function.
On the right, we choose to give the function a name "$f$".
On the left, we describe the function by saying how inputs are transformed into outputs, but we don't give it a name.
The function on the left is just "the function that squares its input".
It doesn't have a name, so this is called an *anonymous function*.

Mathematicians use an anonymous function when they won't want to refer to a function again later, and so have no need of giving it a name.
If you'll want to refer to a function later, it's useful to give it a name when you define it, so you'll write $f(x)= x^2$ (or use some other letter if $f$ is already used for something else).

This pattern also shows up in computer science, although they often call anonymous functions *lambdas* and instead of writing $x \mapsto x^2$ they will write `λx.x^2` or `fun x => x^2` or some variation thereof.

:::

From a very small amount of information, we actually know a lot about $D$.
Thus, we begin this chapter straightforwardly with a question, which is the title of the next section:

## What is the minimal amount of information needed to unambiguously describe a linear function?

Consider the following example:

Assume that $L : P_2 \to P_0$ is linear and that

$$
L(x^2 + 3x) = 4.
$$

Can we determine $L$ on every element of $P_2$?
That is, can we compute

$$
L(a x^2 + b x + c)?
$$

Let's try our best.
We would like to isolate a term that looks like $x^2 + 3x$ because that is something we have information about.

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(a x^2 + b x + c)=& L(a x^2 + b x)  + L(c) \quad &\text{by property 1} \\
=& L\left(a \left[ x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x \right] \right)  + L(c) \quad &\text{assuming } a \ne 0 \\
=& a L\left( x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x \right)  + L(c) &\quad \text{by property 2}  \end{aligned}
$$

then we are basically stuck.
Although we can force $x^2$ to show up, we can't *at the same time* force $3x$ to show up; forcing a coefficient of $1$ on $x^2$ will always effect the coefficient of $x$.
Furthermore, we have no information about how to deal with $L(c)$.

So, in this case, knowing that $L$ is linear and knowing its value on *one* input is insufficient.

::: {#exr-p2-basis}

In the example above, is it enough to know that 
$$
\begin{aligned}
L(x^2) =& 1 , \\
L(x) =& 1 ,
\end{aligned}
$$

to be able to determine $L$ on all of $P_2$?

What if we know 
$$
\begin{aligned}
L(x^2) =& 1 , \\
L(x) =& 1 ,\\
L(1) =& -2 
\end{aligned}?
$$

## Writing vectors relative to a set of vectors

Let $X,Y \in \mathbb R^2$ be given by $X:= (1,1)$ and $Y:= (1,-1)$.
Suppose $L : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$ is linear and also that we know
$$
\begin{aligned}
L(X) =&  1, \\
L(Y) =&  -2 
\end{aligned}.
$$

Can we compute $L$ on the vector $(2,3)$?
If the answer to this question were yes then there would have to be a way to express $(2,3)$ in terms of $X$ and $Y$ (since those are the only two values we know anything about).
That is, there would be $a,b \in \mathbb R$ such that

$$
(2,3) = a X + b Y = a (1,1) + b(1 , -1) = (a , a) + ( b , -b ) = (a + b , a - b).
$$

So, $L$ can be computed on $(2,3)$ if and only if the following system has a solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 =& a + b ,\\
3 =& a - b
\end{aligned}.
$$

We can solve this system (solving for, say, $a$ in the first and substituting the value in the second).
We find that there is only one solution: $a = \frac{5}{2} , b= -\frac{1}{2}$.

Using this information, how do we compute $L(2,3)$?
Well, now we know that

$$
(2,3) = \frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) (1,-1)
$$

so let's just apply the function $L$ to both sides of this equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(2,3) =& L \left[ \frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) (1,-1) \right] \\
=& L \left[ \frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) \right] + L \left[ \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) (1,-1) \right] \\
=& \frac{5}{2} L   (1 , 1) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) L  (1,-1) \\
=& \frac{5}{2} 1 + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) (-2) \\
=& \frac{5}{2}  + 1\\
=& \frac{7}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {#exr-lin-example-justification}

For each $=$-symbol in the computation above, write the assumption, property, or rule that tells us we are allowed to conclude the left hand side is equal to the right hand side.

:::

The above computation shows that the answer to our question is yes, this amount of information about $L$ is sufficient to compute $L(2,3)$.
Notice that this is the case even though we were not given the formula for $L$.

You may want to convince yourself that the vector $(2,3)$ above was not special; given the information we have about $L$, we can compute $L(k,l)$ for any $(k,l) \in \mathbb R^2$.

::: {#exr-lin-nonexample}

If we know that $L : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$ is linear and that

$$
L(0,1) = 1 , \quad L(0,2) = 2,
$$

can we compute $L(1,2)$?
If yes, compute it.
If no, why not?

### Linear combinations

The trick to computing $L(2,3)$ in the previous section was to rewrite $(2,3)$ in the form

$$
(2,3) = a (1,1) + b(1 , -1).
$$

This is a good ansatz[^1] because we are able to split over the $+$ and pull the $a$ and $b$ out (using the fact that $L$ is linear).

[^1]: This is a German word that, in math, means a guess with some free parameters (in this case, $a$ and $b$) in it. We compute with this guess, and then later find values of the parameters that make the computation valid and also solve our problem. If we cannot find such values, the we have essentially proved that there is no solution to our problem with the form given in the ansatz (although there may be a solution of another form if our ansatz is not general enough).

::: {#def-linear-combination}

If $X_1, X_2 , \ldots , X_n$ is a collection of vectors in the vector space $V$, then any expression of the form

$$
a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 + \cdots + a_n X^n, \quad a_i \in F
$$

is called a *linear combination* of $X_1, X_2 , \ldots , X_n$.

:::

We then have the following generalization of the computation we did in the example above:

::: {#thm-linear-function-sufficiency-1}

Let $L: A \to B$ be linear. These two statements are equivalent:

- We know the value of $L$ on a set of vectors $X_1 ,  X_2 , \ldots , X_n \in A$.
  That is, 

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  L(X_1) =& Y_1 \\
  L(X_2) =& Y_2 \\
  \vdots & \\
  L(X_n) =& Y_n 
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  for some $Y_i \in B$.

- We know the value of $L$ on any linear combination of $X_1 ,  X_2 , \ldots , X_n$.

:::

The proof $\implies$ is a straightforward application of properties 1 and 2 of linear functions.
You might try to generate the justification yourself.
The proof of $\impliedby$ is an application of proof by contradiction.

::: {.callout-note}

@thm-linear-function-sufficiency-1 is not a tautology!

The set $\{X_1 ,  X_2 , \ldots , X_n\}$ is a finite set (think of $\{(1,1) , (1,-1)\}$ which contains only 2 elements).

The set of linear combinations of $\{X_1 ,  X_2 , \ldots , X_n\}$ is *infinite* (if the field of scalars is infinite, which in the case of $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$ it is).

The set of linear combinations of $\{(1,1) , (1,-1)\}$ contains, for example,
$$
\begin{aligned}
&(1,1),(2,2),(a,a) \forall a \in \mathbb R ,\\
&(\pi,e),\left(\sqrt{2},2025^{1/3}\right),\\
&a(1,1) + b(1,-1) = (a+b,a-b) \forall a,b \in \mathbb R.
\end{aligned}
$$
In particular, this set is infinite.

:::

### The span of a set of vectors

We will use the words "is a linear combination of" or "can be expressed as a linear combination of" quite often, so we introduce some terminology to shorthand this.

::: {#def-span}

If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, $X_1 , \ldots , X_n \in V$, and $W$ is expressible as a linear combination of $\{X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ we say that $W$ is in the *span* of $\{X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$. We can write this

$$
W \in \Span \{X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}.
$$

We also refer to the following set as *the span* of $\{X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$:
$$
\Span \{X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} := \{ a_1 X_1 + \cdots + a_n X_n \mid a_i \in F \}.
$$

:::

So, for example, $(0,2025) \in \Span \{(0,1),(0,6)\}$, but the vector $(17,9) \not \in \Span \{(0,1),(0,6)\}$.

::: {#exr-span-basis}
Let $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$.
Is $(a,b) \in \Span \{ (1,1) , (1,-1) \}$?
Why or why not?
:::


::: {#exr-span-dependent}
Let $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$.
Is $(a,b) \in \Span \{ (1,2) , (1 ,5) , (1 , -3) \}$?
Why or why not?
:::

Given the above definition, we can rephrase @thm-linear-function-sufficiency-1:

::: {#thm-linear-function-sufficiency-2}

Let $L: A \to B$ be linear. These two statements are equivalent:

- We know the value of $L$ on a set of vectors $X_1 ,  X_2 , \ldots , X_n \in A$.
- We know the value of $L$ on $\Span \{ X_1 ,  X_2 , \cdots , X_n \}$.

:::

There isn't really anything to prove here; this is exactly @thm-linear-function-sufficiency-1 except with "any linear combination of" replaced by $\Span$, which is @def-span.

::: {#exr-p2-sufficiency}
Is $\Span \{ 1 + x , x + x^2 \} = P_2$? Why or why not?
:::

::: {#exr-p3-sufficiency}
Show that $\Span \{ 1 + x , x + x^2, x^2 , x^3 \} = P_3$ by finding a representation of
$$
ax^3 + b x^2 + c x + d 
$$
(which is the form of a generic element of $P_3$) as a linear combination of $\{ 1 + x , x + x^2, x^2 , x^3 \}$.
:::

::: {#exr-diff-span}
Suppose we know that $F'(x) = f(x)$ and $G'(x) = g(x)$ (that is, $F,G$ have derivatives, and we give the names $f,g$ to those derivatives).
Recall the definition of the operator $D$ for differentiation:
$$
D(h) := h'(x),
$$
and that we already know $D : \{ \text{differentiable functions} \} \to \{ \text{ functions}\}$ is linear.

Is it true that $D(F(x) + 14G(x))=f(x) + 16 g(x)$?
Did you use any properties about $D$ *other than* linearity to conclude that?

Suppose $G(x) > 0 , \forall x$.
Is it true that 
$$
D\left [ \frac{F(x)}{G(x)} \right] = \frac{f(x) G(x) - F(x)g(x)}{\left[G(x)\right]^2}?
$$
Did you use any properties about $D$ *other than* linearity to conclude that?

### Linear independence

Suppose we have a collection of vectors $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} \in \mathbb R^2$.
We have seen examples where 

1. $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ consists of two vectors and $\Span \{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ **is not all of** $\mathbb R^2$ 

   (this happened when $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} = \{(0,1) , (0,2)\}$),

1. $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ consists of two vectors and $\Span \{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ **is equal to** $\mathbb R^2$ 

   (this happened when $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} = \{(1,1) , (1,-1)\}$),

1. $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ consists of three vectors and $\Span \{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ **is equal to** $\mathbb R^2$ 

   (this happened when $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} = \{(1,2) , (1 , 6) , (1,-3)\}$).

In the last case, we got something extra; there were infinitely many ways of representing an arbitrary element $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$ as a linear combination of $\{(1,2) , (1 , 6) , (1,-3)\}$.
In the second case, we get a unique way of representing each vector as a linear combination, and in the first case we don't even get any way to represent some vectors as a linear combination.

From @def-span we now can say that the distinction between the first case and the other two is that

$$
\Span \{(1,1) , (1,-1)\} = \Span \{(1,2) , (1 , 6) , (1,-3)\} = \mathbb R^2
$$

but that

$$
\Span \{(0,1) , (0,2)\} \ne \mathbb R^2.
$$

From @thm-linear-function-sufficiency-2, we know that if we know a linear function on the two vectors

$$
(1,1) , (1,-1)
$$

or on the three vectors

$$
(1,2) , (1 , 6) , (1,-3)
$$

then we know its value on all inputs $(a,b) \in \mathbb R^2$.

What is the criterion that distinguishes the second case from the last one?
That is, is there a property of a set of vectors 
$$
\{(1,2) , (1 , 6) , (1,-3)\}
$$ 
from the set of vectors 
$$
\{(1,1) , (1,-1)\}
$$ 
that tells is that we get a unique linear combination in the latter case, but a nonunique linear combination in the former case?
It turns out to be the following definition, and we will see why in a later part of the book.

::: {#def-linear-independence}

Let $V$ be a vector space and $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \} \subset V$.
We say that the set $\{ X_1 , \ldots , X_n \}$ is *linearly independent* if, for each $i \in \{ 1 , \ldots , n \}$,

$$
X_i \not \in \Span \{X_1 , X_2 , \cdots , X_{i-1} , X_{i + 1} , \cdots , X_n\}.
$$

This is another way of saying that $X_i$ is **not** in the span of all the $\{ X_j \}$ with $X_i$ removed.
