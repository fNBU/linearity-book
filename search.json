    "text": "The perspective of these notes\nThese notes are constructed to vindicate the following objectives:\n\nIt is morally right for course materials to be free. Few existing books on this subject in English satisfy this criterion (eg Hefferon (2022) is GFDL or CC BY-SA 3.0 US, Treil (2024) is CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 with source unavailable). This book, and the source used to generate it are freely available with a permissive license.\nIn practice, scientists, engineers, etc. need to be able to recognize linearity so that they may choose the correct solution techniques. They also need to understand why linear problems are preferable to non-linear ones so that they might try to massage their current problem into a linear one.\nWhen we say “solution techniques” as above, 99% of the time we mean software packages. Mathematicians and physicists teach linear algebra techniques in colleges and universities, and emphasize by-hand solution techniques for historical and cultural reasons. Most working people who encounter such problems do not use such techniques, they recognize that their problem is linear and offload the problem to a software package. Mathematicians and physicists generally get a second pass at learning linear algebra in a more theory-heavy context (at the very least when learning modules), and so do not need that approach in a first course.\nThe usefulness of linear algebra techniques stems wholly from the homomorphism property of linear maps:\n\\[ L(a V + b W) = a L(V) + b L(W) \\]\nNo introductory, open-access, English language books on the topic that I am aware of motivate the study of the subject with this point. They traditionally begin with coordinate geometry or solving systems of linear equations. It is a very mathematicians’ way of thinking to motivate study of a topic by identifying a class of equations and asking “How do we solve them? What properties do they have?” This is not a way of thinking that is useful for people encountering linearity in the wild.\nMany advanced undergraduate books like Axler (2024) begin with the definition of a vector space. It is also a very mathematician’s way of thiking to begin with a definition of a set of objects which will be mapped into or out of (viz. most treatments of Abstract Algebra). To talk about maps (which are really the objects of interest), surely we must first talk about (co)domains!\nCoordinate geometry is, at least, a class of real problems where linear techniques naturally arise, but the relevance of this as an example from “the wild” has basically vanished in the last 70 years. Today’s scientists and engineers are more likely to encounter linearity in optimization, data science, machine learning, or numerical PDEs.\n\nSo, for these reasons, I set out to write my own course notes.\n\n\n\n\nAxler, Sheldon. 2024.

Why is this the case?\nWhat do we mean by scaling a figure in the plane by a factor of 2? Well, a reasonable answer is to say that a figure is a set of points and each point has an \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinate. For example, the circle of radius \\(r\\) is the set of points with coordinates given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx =& r \\cos \\theta \\\\\ny =& r \\sin \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nWe introduced a symbol above: \\(\\in\\). This literally means “in” or “is in” depending on context.\nFor example, \\(\\pi \\in \\mathbb R\\) means “pi is in the real numbers”.\nSometimes we will want to list the set first, like \\(\\mathbb R \\ni \\pi\\). In this case we read it as “the real numbers contain pi.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nWhen we want to refer to a set, we will often use notation like the following:\n\\[\n\\left\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb R^2 \\left| \\begin{aligned} x =& r \\cos \\theta \\\\ y =& r \\sin \\theta \\end{aligned} \\quad, \\theta \\in [0,2\\pi] \\right. \\right\\}.\n\\]\nIn general, this notation has the form\n\\[\nB=\\left\\{ f(x_1,x_2,...) \\in A \\left| \\begin{aligned} & \\text{ constraints involving }  \\\\ & x_1,x_2,... \\end{aligned} \\right. \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe process for constructing the set \\(B\\) is the following:\n\nFind all the \\(x_i\\) that satisfy the constraints to the right of the \\(\\mid\\) symbol.\nPlug all the \\(x_i\\) you found in the previous step into the function \\(f\\).\nThe function \\(f\\) produces things in \\(A\\), and so the set of all the things you produced in the last step is a collection of some (but not necessarily all) of the things in \\(A\\).\nThis is the set \\(B\\).\n\n\n\nConsider the point \\((4,2)\\) in the plane. We can think of this point as the “sum” of its \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates:\n\\[\n(4,2) = (4,0) + (0,2).\n\\]\nTo scale this point by a factor of 2, it seems reasonable to multiply both coordinates by 2:\n\\[\nS_2((4,2)) = (8,4).\n\\]\nNotice that the function \\(S_2 : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\) “multiply coordinates by 2” has properties 1 and 2.\n\nExercise 1.4 Verify this.\n\n\nExercise 1.5 Check that applying \\(S_2\\) to a circle of radius \\(r\\) produces a circle of radius \\(2r\\).\n\nNow, for any curve \\(\\gamma : [a,b] \\to \\mathbb R^2\\) given by\n\\[\n\\gamma(t) = (x(t) , y(t)),\n\\]\nits length can be computed by\n\\[\n\\int _{a}^{b}{\\sqrt {x'(t)^{2}+y'(t)^{2}}} \\quad dt.\n\\]\n(You may have seen this in multivariable calculus or physics.) Consider the composition\n\\[\n[a,b] \\xrightarrow{\\quad \\gamma \\quad} \\mathbb R^2 \\xrightarrow{\\quad S_2 \\quad} \\mathbb R^2\n\\]\nThe formula is\n\\[\n( S_2 \\circ \\gamma )(x) =  ( 2 x(t) , 2 y(t) )\n\\]\nand the length is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\int _{a}^{b}{\\sqrt {\\left(\\left[2x(t)\\right]'\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\left[2y(t)\\right]'\\right)^{2}}} \\quad dt \\\\\n=&\\int _{a}^{b}{\\sqrt {\\left(2x'(t)\\right)^{2}+\\left(2y'(t)\\right)^{2}}} \\quad dt \\\\\n=&\\int _{a}^{b}{\\sqrt {4\\left(x'(t)\\right)^{2}+4\\left(y'(t)\\right)^{2}}} \\quad dt \\\\\n=&\\int _{a}^{b}{2\\sqrt {\\left(x'(t)\\right)^{2}+\\left(y'(t)\\right)^{2}}} \\quad dt \\\\\n=&2\\int _{a}^{b}{\\sqrt {\\left(x'(t)\\right)^{2}+\\left(y'(t)\\right)^{2}}} \\quad dt\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice that what we obtain on the last line is exactly twice the length of the curve \\(\\gamma\\). Convince yourself that there is nothing special about the number 2 here; if we had replaced \\(S_2\\) by \\(S_{17}\\), then we would have obtained 17 times the length of \\(\\gamma\\) in the last line.\n\n\nMore functions which break up over “sums”\n\nDifferentiation\nNow consider how we compute the derivative of a function like the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 2x^2 + x \\right] &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 2x^2 \\right] + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x \\right] \\\\\n&= 2\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x^2 \\right] + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x \\right] \\\\\n&= 4x + 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we let \\(D : \\text{FUNCTIONS} \\to \\text{FUNCTIONS}\\) be the operation of taking a derivative, then in the first line we used\n\\[ D[f_1(x) + f_2(x)] = D[f_1(x)] + D[f_2(x)] \\]\nand in the second line we used the fact that, when \\(k\\) is constant,\n\\[ D[k f(x)] = k D[f(x)]. \\]\nThus, \\(D\\) (that is, differentiation) satisfies properties 1 and 2. (Although you should probably be uncomfortable that we wrote \\(D : \\text{FUNCTIONS} \\to \\text{FUNCTIONS}\\) above. What is the set \\(\\text{FUNCTIONS}\\)? Are all functions differentiable? We will address this later. For now, it suffices to replace \\(\\text{FUNCTIONS}\\) above with \\(P_n\\), the set of all polynomials of degree at most \\(n\\). In fact, it is the case that \\(D : P_n \\to P_{n-1}\\) if \\(n\\geq 1\\).)\n\n\nDefinite integration\nFix an interval \\([a,b]\\) and consider \\[\nI(f) := \\int_a^b f(x) \\quad dx.\n\\]\n\nExercise 1.6 Check that \\(I\\) has properties 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\nWhy are properties 1 and 2 useful?\nWhy is it useful that \\(D\\) satisfies properties 1 and 2? It allows us to compute derivatives of complicated expressions like \\(2x^2 + x\\) if we only know the computation on some simple parts of the expression. Knowing the derivative of \\(x^2\\) and \\(x\\) is all that is needed.\nSimilarly, if we know the circumference of a shape in the plane at one scale, we can compute its circumference at all scales using property 1.\nNot all functions are linear, but if a function is linear, it is much easier to compute with.",

Similarly we can conclude that \\(V\\) must be closed under scalar multiplication.\nAll of the properties above hold (with the field of scalars \\(F\\) set to \\(\\mathbb R\\)) for all the spaces we have used so far as the domain and codomain of a linear function. (You may want to check this for yourself quickly. Most of these facts obviously hold for polynomials, functions, points in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\), and \\(\\mathbb R\\) itself. However, one must still check all of them before using a set as the domain or codomain of a linear function.)\nNot all sets of mathematical objects satisfy these properties, though. An example is the set of points on the sphere. It turns out that there is no way (although the proof will have to wait for a future chapter) to turn that set into a vector space.\nThe way you should think about this definition is the following:\nAn example of the kind of problem you can run into is the following: Let \\(L:A \\to B\\) be linear and suppose \\(A\\) is a vector space as defined above but that \\(B\\) fails to have an additive identity (that is, there is no zero vector in \\(B\\)). We can compute\n\\[\nL(0) = 0L(0) = 0 (?) = 0\n\\] where the \\(?\\) stands for whatever \\(L(0)\\) maps to. Notice that in the end, it doesn’t matter because we conclude that \\(L(0) = 0 \\in B\\).

It’s quite a lengthy process to verify all the properties in Definition 2.1, even if in many cases it is not difficult to verify each one individually. We are in need of machines that allow us to know that something is a vector space more easily. That is what this and the next section are about.\nHow do we know that a set \\(W \\subset V\\) is a vector space?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nAbove, we used the symbol \\(\\subset\\). This just means “is a sub set of”, for example \\(\\mathbb Z \\subset \\mathbb Q\\) means “the set of integers is a subset of the set of rational numbers.”\nWhen we say “A is a subset of B” or, equivalently write \\(A \\subset B\\), we mean that everything in \\(A\\) is also in \\(B\\).\nWe will sometimes write \\(A \\supset B\\) to mean that \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(A\\) or that “A has B as a subset.”\n\n\nWe’ve already seen some examples of this. For example, we know that differentiable functions form a vector space, and also the set \\(P_n\\) forms a vector space. Since every polynomial is differentiable, it follows that \\(P_n \\subset \\{ \\text{differentiable functions}\\}\\). So \\(P_n\\) is an example of a subset of a vector space that turns out to be a vector space itself.\nLet’s introduce some terminology for this situation.\n\nDefinition 2.3 A subset \\(W\\) of a vector space \\(V\\) is called a (vector) subspace if \\(W\\) is itself a vector space (with field of scalars \\(F\\), addition, multiplication, zero vector inherited from \\(V\\)).\n\nWe have already seen an example of a subspace above. A nonexample is the set of points in the plane at distance 1 from the origin. This set doesn’t satisfy the closure assumptions of Definition 2.1.\nIt is a bit remarkable (although not difficult to prove) that we actually only need to check the closure assumptions. The following theorem encodes this fact.\n\nTheorem 2.1 A subset \\(W\\) of a vector space \\(V\\) is itself a vector space (with field of scalars \\(F\\), addition, multiplication, zero vector inherited from \\(V\\)) iff the following two properties hold:\n\n\\(W\\) is closed under scalar multiplication: \\(aX \\in W \\quad \\forall a \\in F, X \\in W\\)\n\\(W\\) is closed under vector addition: \\(X+Y \\in W \\quad \\forall X,Y \\in W\\)\n\n\nWe won’t do the proof here (you can go to e.g. Hefferon (2022) to see it), but we will sketch it.\nSince the scalars, and the operations \\(\\cdot , +\\) are inherited from the ambient space \\(V\\), they are known to satisfy associativity, commutativity, existence of inverses and zeros, etc (because we had to prove those things when we showed that \\(V\\) was a vector space). However, in Definition 2.1, we wrote \\(+ \\colon V \\times V \\to V\\). That is, \\(+\\) takes two vectors in \\(V\\) and returns a vector in \\(V\\). Since \\(W \\subset V\\), we know that we can use elements of \\(W\\) as inputs to \\(+\\). That is, we know \\(+ \\colon W \\times W \\to V\\), but we cannot know addition of vectors always lands in the subset \\(W\\). The first assumption above tells us this. Similarly for scalar multiplication.\nFor the proof in the opposite direction, notice that for \\(W\\) to be a vector space we must have \\(+ \\colon W \\times W \\to W\\). If addition is not closed, then \\(+\\) has the wrong codomain, and \\(W\\) isn’t a vector space. Similarly if \\(W\\) is not closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nEasier subspaces\nNotice that we can use Theorem 2.1 to quite easily prove (assuming we know differentiable functions form a vector space) that \\(P_n\\) is a vector space. We can also conclude easily that, for example,\n\\[\n\\{ a \\sin x + b \\cos x \\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb R \\}\n\\]\nis a vector space.\n\nExercise 2.5 Is the set of arrows that are either fully horizontal or fully vertical a vector subspace of the vector space of arrows in 2D? Why?\n\n\nExercise 2.6 Consider the set of monomials\n\\[\n\\{ 1 , x , x^2 , x^3 , \\ldots  \\} .\n\\]\nIf I pick any two of these (say \\(x^k\\) and \\(x^l\\) with \\(k \\ne l\\), eg \\(x^{17}\\) and \\(x^{2025}\\)) and form the set\n\\[\n\\{ a x^k + b x^l \\mid a,b \\in \\mathbb R \\} ,\n\\]\nis this a vector subspace of the space of differentiable functions? Why?",

    "text": "What is the minimal amount of information needed to unambiguously describe a linear function?\nRemember that the derivative function \\(D(f) := \\frac{df}{dx}\\) allows us to compute the derivative of, for example\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 4 \\sin x\n\\]\nif we know how to compute \\(D\\) on only \\(x^2\\) and \\(\\sin x\\). In fact, knowing just how to compute \\(D\\) on these two functions and knowing that \\(D\\) is linear allows us to compute the derivative of any function of the form\n\\[\nx \\mapsto a x^2 + b \\sin x , \\quad a,b \\in \\mathbb R.\n\\]\nFrom a very small amount of information, we actually know a lot about \\(D\\). Thus, we begin this chapter straightforwardly with a question, which is the title of the next section:\nConsider the following example:\nAssume that \\(L : P_2 \\to P_0\\) is linear and that\n\\[\nL(x^2 + 3x) = 4.\n\\]\nCan we determine \\(L\\) on every element of \\(P_2\\)? That is, can we compute\n\\[\nL(a x^2 + b x + c)?\n\\]\nLet’s try our best. We would like to isolate a term that looks like \\(x^2 + 3x\\) because that is something we have information about.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(a x^2 + b x + c)=& L(a x^2 + b x)  + L(c) \\quad &\\text{by property 1} \\\\\n=& L\\left(a \\left[ x^2 + \\frac{b}{a} x \\right] \\right)  + L(c) \\quad &\\text{assuming } a \\ne 0 \\\\\n=& a L\\left( x^2 + \\frac{b}{a} x \\right)  + L(c) &\\quad \\text{by property 2}  \\end{aligned}\n\\]\nthen we are basically stuck. Although we can force \\(x^2\\) to show up, we can’t at the same time force \\(3x\\) to show up; forcing a coefficient of \\(1\\) on \\(x^2\\) will always effect the coefficient of \\(x\\). Furthermore, we have no information about how to deal with \\(L(c)\\).\nSo, in this case, knowing that \\(L\\) is linear and knowing its value on one input is insufficient.",

    "text": "Writing vectors relative to a set of vectors\nLet \\(X,Y \\in \\mathbb R^2\\) be given by \\(X:= (1,1)\\) and \\(Y:= (1,-1)\\). Suppose \\(L : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R\\) is linear and also that we know \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(X) =&  1, \\\\\nL(Y) =&  -2\n\\end{aligned}.\n\\]\nCan we compute \\(L\\) on the vector \\((2,3)\\)? If the answer to this question were yes then there would have to be a way to express \\((2,3)\\) in terms of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (since those are the only two values we know anything about). That is, there would be \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb R\\) such that\n\\[\n(2,3) = a X + b Y = a (1,1) + b(1 , -1) = (a , a) + ( b , -b ) = (a + b , a - b).\n\\]\nSo, \\(L\\) can be computed on \\((2,3)\\) if and only if the following system has a solution:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 =& a + b ,\\\\\n3 =& a - b\n\\end{aligned}.\n\\]\nWe can solve this system (solving for, say, \\(a\\) in the first and substituting the value in the second). We find that there is only one solution: \\(a = \\frac{5}{2} , b= -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nUsing this information, how do we compute \\(L(2,3)\\)? Well, now we know that\n\\[\n(2,3) = \\frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) (1,-1)\n\\]\nso let’s just apply the function \\(L\\) to both sides of this equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(2,3) =& L \\left[ \\frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) (1,-1) \\right] \\\\\n=& L \\left[ \\frac{5}{2} (1 , 1) \\right] + L \\left[ \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) (1,-1) \\right] \\\\\n=& \\frac{5}{2} L   (1 , 1) + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) L  (1,-1) \\\\\n=& \\frac{5}{2} 1 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) (-2) \\\\\n=& \\frac{5}{2}  + 1\\\\\n=& \\frac{7}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nExercise 3.2 For each \\(=\\)-symbol in the computation above, write the assumption, property, or rule that tells us we are allowed to conclude the left hand side is equal to the right hand side.\n\nThe above computation shows that the answer to our question is yes, this amount of information about \\(L\\) is sufficient to compute \\(L(2,3)\\). Notice that this is the case even though we were not given the formula for \\(L\\).\nYou may want to convince yourself that the vector \\((2,3)\\) above was not special; given the information we have about \\(L\\), we can compute \\(L(k,l)\\) for any \\((k,l) \\in \\mathbb R^2\\).\n\nExercise 3.3 If we know that \\(L : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R\\) is linear and that\n\\[\nL(0,1) = 1 , \\quad L(0,2) = -6,\n\\]\ncan we compute \\(L(1,2)\\)? If yes, compute it. If no, why not?\n\n\nExercise 3.4 If we know that \\(L : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R\\) is linear and that\n\\[\nL(0,1) = 2 , \\quad L(1,1) = 2,\n\\]\ncan we compute \\(L(1,2)\\)? If yes, compute it. If no, why not?\n\n\nLinear combinations\nThe trick to computing \\(L(2,3)\\) in the previous section was to rewrite \\((2,3)\\) in the form\n\\[\n(2,3) = a (1,1) + b(1 , -1).\n\\]\nThis is a good ansatz[^1] because we are able to split over the \\(+\\) and pull the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) out (using the fact that \\(L\\) is linear). [^1]: This is a German word that, in math, means a guess with some free parameters (in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in it. We compute with this guess, and then later find values of the parameters that make the computation valid. This pattern is so common when working with linear functions that we have a name for it:\n\nDefinition 3.1 If \\(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots , X_n\\) is a collection of vectors in the vector space \\(V\\), then any expression of the form\n\\[\na_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 + \\cdots + a_n X^n, \\quad a_i \\in F\n\\]\nis called a linear combination of \\(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots , X_n\\).\n\nWe then have the following generalization of the computation we did in the example above:\n\nTheorem 3.1 Let \\(L: A \\to B\\) be linear, and suppose we know the value of \\(L\\) on a set of vectors \\(X_1 ,  X_2 , \\ldots , X_n \\in A\\). That is,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(X_1) =& Y_1 \\\\\nL(X_2) =& Y_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\\\\nL(X_n) =& Y_n\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nfor some \\(Y_i \\in B\\).\nThen the value of \\(L\\) is known on any linear combination of \\(X_1 ,  X_2 , \\ldots , X_n\\).\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a straightforward application of properties 1 and 2 of linear functions. You might try to generate the justification yourself.\n\n\nThe span of a set of vectors\n[TODO]\n\n\nLinear independence\n[TODO]\n\n\nA basis for a vector space\n[TODO]",
