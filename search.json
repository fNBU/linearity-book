Students may skip this section.\nLinear Algebra, like Calculus, is one of the math subjects with the most textbooks, so it’s reasonable to ask why a new set of notes is needed. Plainly, I looked at the six open-access books on the subject on the AIMath website and found that none of them were fit for my purpose (detailed below).",

    "text": "The perspective of these notes\nThese notes are constructed to vindicate the following objectives:\n\nIt is morally right for course materials to be free. Few existing books on this subject in English satisfy this criterion. This book, and the source used to generate it are freely available with a permissive license.\nIn practice, scientists, engineers, etc. need to be able to recognize linearity so that they may choose the correct solution techniques. They also need to understand why linear problems are preferable to non-linear ones so and that they might try to massage their current problem into a linear one.\nWhen we say “solution techniques” as above, 99% of the time we mean software packages. Mathematicians and physicists teach linear algebra techniques in colleges and universities, and emphasize by-hand solution techniques for historical and cultural reasons. Most working people who encounter such problems do not use such techniques, they recognize that their problem is linear and offload the problem to a software package. Mathematicians and physicists generally get a second pass at learning linear algebra in a more theory-heavy context (at the very least when learning modules), and so do not need that approach in a first course.\nThe usefulness of linear algebra techniques stems wholly from the homomorphism property of linear maps:\n\\[ L(a V + b W) = a L(V) + b L(W) \\]\nNo introductory, open-access, English language books on the topic that I am aware of motivate the study of the subject with this point. They traditionally begin with coordinate geometry or solving systems of linear equations. It is a very mathematicians’ way of thinking to motivate study of a topic by identifying a class of equations and asking “How do we solve them? What properties do they have?” This is not a way of thinking that is useful for people encountering linearity in the wild. Axler (2024) is an example of an open text that properly emphasizes this aspect from the beginning, but is not suitable for a class where students have not yet learned proofs.\nCoordinate geometry is, at least, a class of real problems where linear techniques naturally arise, but the relevance of this as an example from “the wild” has basically vanished in the last 70 years. Today’s scientists and engineers are more likely to encounter linearity in optimization, data science, machine learning, or numerical PDEs.\n\nSo, for these reasons, I set out to write my own course notes.\n\n\n\n\nAxler, Sheldon. 2024.

    "text": "Two properties\nThe function \\(C : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R\\) given by\n\\[ C(r) := 2 \\pi r \\]\ncomputes the circumference of a circle, given its radius.\nThe circumference of a circle has a couple nice properties. First, the circumference of a circle of radius 14 is twice the circumference of a circle of radius 7:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC(7) &= 2 \\pi (7) = 14 \\pi   \\\\\nC(14) &= 2 \\pi (14) = 28 \\pi   \n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis holds in general; multiplying the radius of a circle by \\(k\\) also changes the circumference by a factor of \\(k\\):\n\\[ C(k r) = k C(r) . \\]\nFurthermore, adding any amount to the radius increases the circumference in a predictable way:\n\\[ C(r_1 + r_2) = C(r_1) + C(r_2). \\]\nIt’s a bit remarkable that these two properties hold not just for circles; scaling any shape in the plane (with circumference \\(c\\)) by a factor of \\(k\\) multiplies its circumference by \\(k\\) (its new circumference is \\(kc\\)), and increasing the scale by a constant \\(s\\) increases its circumference by \\(sc\\).\nWhat other functions have the following two properties?\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Property 1:} \\quad & f(a x )= a f(x) \\\\\n\\text{Property 2:} \\quad & f( x + y ) = f(x) + f(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

Why is this the case?\nWhat do we mean by scaling a figure in the plane by a factor of 2? Well, a reasonable answer is to say that a figure is a set of points and each point has an \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinate. For example, the circle of radius \\(r\\) is the set of points with coordinates given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx =& r \\cos \\theta \\\\\ny =& r \\sin \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi]\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nWhen we want to refer to a set, we will often use notation like the following:\n\\[\n\\left\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb R^2 \\mid x = r \\cos \\theta , y = r \\sin \\theta , \\theta \\in [0,2\\pi] \\right\\}.\n\\]\nIn general, this notation has the form\n\\[\nB=\\left\\{ f(x_1,x_2,...) \\in A \\mid \\text{ constraints involving } x_1,x_2,... \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe process for constructing the set \\(B\\) is the following:\n\nFind all the \\(x_i\\) that satisfy the constraints to the right of the \\(\\mid\\) symbol.\nPlug all the \\(x_i\\) you found in the previous step into the function \\(f\\).\nThe function \\(f\\) produces things in \\(A\\), and so the set of all the things you produced in the last step is a collection of some (but not necessarily all) of the things in \\(A\\).\nThis is the set \\(B\\).\n\n\n\nConsider the point \\((4,2)\\) in the plane. We can think of this point as the “sum” of its \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates:\n\\[\n(4,2) = (4,0) + (0,2).\n\\]\nTo scale this point by a factor of 2, it seems reasonable to multiply both coordinates by 2:\n\\[\nS_2((4,2)) = (8,4).\n\\]\nNotice that the function \\(S_2 : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\) “multiply coordinates by 2” has properties 1 and 2.\n\nExercise 1.4 Verify this.\n\n\nExercise 1.5 Check that applying \\(S_2\\) to a circle of radius \\(r\\) produces a circle of radius \\(2r\\).\n\n\n\nMore functions which break up over “sums”\nNow consider how we compute the derivative of a function like the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 2x^2 + x \\right] &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 2x^2 \\right] + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x \\right] \\\\\n&= 2\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x^2 \\right] + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x \\right] \\\\\n&= 4x + 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we let \\(D : \\text{FUNCTIONS} \\to \\text{FUNCTIONS}\\) be the operation of taking a derivative, then in the first line we used\n\\[ D[f_1(x) + f_2(x)] = D[f_1(x)] + D[f_2(x)] \\]\nand in the second line we used the fact that, when \\(k\\) is constant,\n\\[ D[k f(x)] = k D[f(x)]. \\]\nThus, \\(D\\) (that is, differentiation) satisfies properties 1 and 2. (Although you should probably be uncomfortable that we wrote \\(D : \\text{FUNCTIONS} \\to \\text{FUNCTIONS}\\) above. What is the set \\(\\text{FUNCTIONS}\\)? Are all functions differentiable? We will address this later.)\nWhy is it useful that \\(D\\) satisfies properties 1 and 2? It allows us to compute derivatives of complicated expressions like \\(2x^2 + x\\) if we only know the computation on some simple parts of the expression. Knowing the derivative of \\(x^2\\) and \\(x\\) is all that is needed.\nSimilarly, if we know the circumference of a shape in the plane at one scale, we can compute its circumference at all scales using property 1.",
