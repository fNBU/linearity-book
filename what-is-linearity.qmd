# What is Linearity?

The function $C : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ given by 

$$ C(r) := 2 \pi r $$

computes the circumference of a circle, given its radius.

::: {.callout-tip title="Notation"}

First, let's talk about this notation.

The notation $C : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ tells you about the inputs and outputs of the function $C.$
When we write $f : A \to B$, we mean that $f$ takes inputs from the set $A$ and creates outputs in the set $B$.
You can think of $f$ as a machine transforming $A$s into $B$s.

::: {#rem-function-colon}

## $:=$ notation -->

The notation $C(r) := 2 \pi r$ tells you that the *definition* of the function $C$ appears here.
This is to avoid confusion like the following:

$$ f(x) = x^2 $$

If the function $f$ hasn't appeared before, then this equation is probably a definition.
But if we wrote "Given $f(x) = x - 2$, solve the equation $f(x) = x^2$", then the same equation is not a definition.
To avoid this ambiguity, when we write an equals sign with a colon on one side like this $A := B$ or $B =: A$, we mean that the name on the side of the $=$ *with* the colon is defined to be the expression on the side without.

The circumference of a circle has a couple nice properties.
First, the circumference of a circle of radius 14 is twice the circumference of a circle of radius 7:

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
C(7) &= 2 \pi (7) = 14 \pi   \\
C(14) &= 2 \pi (14) = 28 \pi   
\end{aligned}
$$

This holds in general; multiplying the radius of a circle by $k$ also changes the circumference by a factor of $k$:

$$ C(k r) = k C(r) . $$

Furthermore, adding any amount to the radius increases the circumference in a predictable way:

$$ C(r_1 + r_2) = C(r_1) + C(r_2). $$

It's a bit remarkable that these two properties hold not just for circles; scaling any shape in the plane (with circumference $c$) by a factor of $k$ multiplies its circumference by $k$ (its new circumference is $kc$), and increasing the scale by a constant $s$ increases its circumference by $sc$.

## Two properties

What other functions have the following two properties?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Property 1:} \quad & f(a x )= a f(x) \\
\text{Property 2:} \quad & f( x + y ) = f(x) + f(y)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Classification of functions satisfying Properties 1 and 2

So far, we have seen that some functions satisfy properties 1 and 2, and others do not.

| do | don't |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| circumference of a circle as a function of radius | area of a circle as a function of radius |
| circumference of any shape in the plane as a function of scale | area of any shape in the plane as a function of scale |
|  | volume of any shape in 3-dimensions as a function of scale |

: Functions that do and don't satisfy properties 1 and 2

#### Why does scaling satisfy properties 1 & 2 for any shape, not just circles?

We asserted above that property 1 is not just satisfied by circles (when you scale the radius) but is satisfied by all curves.
Why is this the case?

What do we mean by scaling a figure in the plane by a factor of 2?
Well, a reasonable answer is to say that a figure is a set of points and each point has an $x$ and $y$ coordinate.
For example, the circle of radius $r$ is the set of points with coordinates given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
x =& r \cos \theta \\
y =& r \sin \theta 
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$.

::: {.callout-tip title="Notation"}

When we want to refer to a set, we will often use notation like the following:

$$
\left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 \mid x = r \cos \theta , y = r \sin \theta , \theta \in [0,2\pi] \right\}.
$$

In general, this notation has the form

$$
B=\left\{ f(x_1,x_2,...) \in A \mid \text{ constraints involving } x_1,x_2,... \right\}.
$$

The process for constructing the set $B$ is the following:

1. 
    Find all the $x_i$ that satisfy the constraints to the right of the $\mid$ symbol.

1.  
    Plug all the $x_i$ you found in the previous step into the function $f$.

1.  
    The function $f$ produces things in $A$, and so the set of all the things you produced in the last step is a collection of some (but not necessarily all) of the things in $A$.

    This is the set $B$.

Consider the point $(4,2)$ in the plane.
We can think of this point as the "sum" of its $x$ and $y$ coordinates:

$$
(4,2) = (4,0) + (0,2).
$$

To scale this point by a factor of 2, it seems reasonable to multiply both coordinates by 2:

$$
S_2((4,2)) = (8,4).
$$

Notice that the function $S_2 : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ "multiply coordinates by 2" has properties 1 and 2.

::: {#exr-scale-by-2-linear}

Verify this.

:::

::: {#exr-scaling-by-2-circle}

Check that applying $S_2$ to a circle of radius $r$ produces a circle of radius $2r$.

Now, for any curve $\gamma : [a,b] \to \mathbb R^2$ given by

$$
\gamma(t) = (x(t) , y(t)),
$$

its length can be computed by

$$
L=\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {x'(t)^{2}+y'(t)^{2}}} \quad dt.
$$

(You may have seen this in multivariable calculus or physics.)
Consider the composition

$$
[a,b] \xrightarrow{\quad \gamma \quad} \mathbb R^2 \xrightarrow{\quad S_2 \quad} \mathbb R^2
$$

<!-- still trying to get the tikz diagram below to compile -->

<!-- ```{.tikz}
%%| filename: scaling-composition

\usetikzlibrary{matrix}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
  \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em]

     [a,b] & \mathbb R^2 \\};
  \path[-stealth]
    (m-1-1) edge node [above] {$\gamma$} (m-1-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
``` -->

The formula is

$$
( S_2 \circ \gamma )(x) =  ( 2 x(t) , 2 y(t) )
$$

and the length is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
L=&\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {\left(\left[2x(t)\right]'\right)^{2}+\left(\left[2y(t)\right]'\right)^{2}}} \quad dt \\
=&\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {\left(2x'(t)\right)^{2}+\left(2y'(t)\right)^{2}}} \quad dt \\
=&\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {4\left(x'(t)\right)^{2}+4\left(y'(t)\right)^{2}}} \quad dt \\
=&\int _{a}^{b}{2\sqrt {\left(x'(t)\right)^{2}+\left(y'(t)\right)^{2}}} \quad dt \\
=&2\int _{a}^{b}{\sqrt {\left(x'(t)\right)^{2}+\left(y'(t)\right)^{2}}} \quad dt 
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that what we obtain on the last line is exactly twice the length of the curve $\gamma$.
Convince yourself that there is nothing special about the number 2 here; if we had replaced $S_2$ by $S_{17}$, then we would have obtained 17 times the length of $\gamma$ in the last line.


#### More functions which break up over "sums"

##### Differentiation
Now consider how we compute the derivative of a function like the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ 2x^2 + x \right] &= \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 2x^2 \right] + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x \right] \\
&= 2\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right] + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x \right] \\
&= 4x + 1 
\end{aligned}
$$

If we let $D : \text{FUNCTIONS} \to \text{FUNCTIONS}$ be the operation of taking a derivative, then in the first line we used

$$ D[f_1(x) + f_2(x)] = D[f_1(x)] + D[f_2(x)] $$

and in the second line we used the fact that, when $k$ is constant, 

$$ D[k f(x)] = k D[f(x)]. $$

Thus, $D$ (that is, differentiation) satisfies properties 1 and 2.
(Although you should probably be uncomfortable that we wrote $D : \text{FUNCTIONS} \to \text{FUNCTIONS}$ above. 
What is the set $\text{FUNCTIONS}$?
Are all functions differentiable?
We will address this later.
For now, it suffices to replace $\text{FUNCTIONS}$ above with $P_n$, the set of all polynomials of degree $n$.
In fact, it is the case that $D : P_n \to P_{n-1}$ if $n\geq 1$.)

##### Definite integration

Fix an interval $[a,b]$ and consider
$$
I(f) := \int_a^b f(x) \quad dx.
$$

::: {#exr-integration-is-linear}

Check that $I$ has properties 1 and 2.

:::

#### Why are properties 1 and 2 useful

Why is it useful that $D$ satisfies properties 1 and 2?
It allows us to compute derivatives of complicated expressions like $2x^2 + x$ if we only know the computation on some simple parts of the expression.
Knowing the derivative of $x^2$ and $x$ is all that is needed.

Similarly, if we know the circumference of a shape in the plane at one scale, we can compute its circumference at all scales using property 1.

Not all functions are linear, but if a function is linear, it is much easier to compute with.

## Linear functions

::: {#def-linear-function}

## linear function

A function satisfying properties 1 and 2 is called *linear*.

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
We use the term "linear" for these functions, but we also use the word "line" for graphs in the plane with formula $f(x) = m x + b$.
This term is overloaded and means different things in these two contexts.
:::

::: {#exr-when-are-lines-linear}

Show that $f(x) = m x + b$ is only a linear function when $b = 0$.
